# Art-Gallery
Web-app created using Django for the purpose of creating an online store of art

This project involves creating a display of art, from which users can then select and buy, similar to a Flipkart or an Amazon. It was created using Django and HTML5. 
The home page leads to a site, where all the available pieces are shown. Links are provided where users can then see the individual pieces and buy them, if they wish to do so. A search feature has also been created, wherein the search text is compared to the names of all the paintings, and if possible, matching results are displayed. The buying option has not been implemented yet, but it can be implemented by using the Google Checkout API. 
Such an ecommerce site can also be created by using Django packages such as Oscar and Mezzanine Cartridge, but since my aim was to learn Django basics, I have not used these packages.
